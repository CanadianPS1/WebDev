                                <p>After I get out of college I'm going to Apply to a few companys, a few of which being Video Game Studios.</p>
                                <p>I would probuly want to live on the east cost, I'm from an eastern coast town so it just kinda feels wrong not seeing a massive body of water and getting that wind that comes over it, as far as citys go, I'm probuly going to live in NYC.</p>
                                <p>Another thing I want to do is own a plane, while I'm at college I'm gunna start getting a piolets licence so if I enjoy it that would be a hype thing to do.</p>

                                <p>In my House/Apartment I want to have an Office with 4 ultrawide monitors (so efectivly 8 monitors of space).</p>
                                <p>I might also get a dog, Ive always lived with one so their pretty epic, if I do get one it would probuly be a deutsch hound.</p>
                                <p>If I ever have kids I would probuly teach them German when their young (at the same time as english), just because I really like german and if their at an event and wanna say something to me without other people knowing I think its a nice lang to do it in (most people in america dont speak german).</p>
                                <p>Once I get a house I kinda want to make a Robot that can run around on a track thats attached to my ciealing and can controll stuff in my house</p>

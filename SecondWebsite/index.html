                                <p>Yo what up, I'm Lia, I'm from <strong>Erie, PA</strong>. I went to High School at <strong>North West PA Collegiate Accademy</strong> , where I learned to code and played on the League
                                    of Legends Esports Team. If I had to pick how I died I would have to pick drowing, because when I was younger I was swimming in lake Erie, then went under and pastout, and a life
                                    Gard had to save me, but like it didnt heart atall so If I had to pick I would probuly go out like that.
                                </p>
                                <p>I Started Gaming sense I was 3 years old where I mainly played Gran Turismo 3 and Spiro, but sense then Ive been a hardcore gamer. I collect old video Games
                                    That I think are funny like, Shrek the Third. if i didnt get into programing I would of eather became an Animator or a German Translator, but another
                                     option would of been Geologist because I think rocks are really cool.
                                </p>
                                <p>I read my first book in 2nd or 3rd grade <em>(ya I'm pretty good ik)</em>, then prombly got diegnoses with Dislexia, now days I've gotten way better at spelling then
                                    I use to, but as I've aged its become harder for me to read, forcing me to use a special type of glasses for Dislexic people that makes things a bit better
                                     and if I read to much to quickly I'll get a head ache for the rest of the day which is pretty cool.
                                </p>
